# traffic-signal simulation and violation detection
this software enginerring course project for MAIA 
The main idea of this project is to create a simulation of traffic intersection using Python.
Traffic light regulates the flow of traffic between vehicles and pedestrians in one way or another. 
Red light > stop and wait behind the stop lineYellow light > stop unless you crossed the stop line before it turned yellow
Green light > go if the way is clear

Each traffic light has a timer that indicates the time remaining before the traffic light changes from green to yellow, yellow to red, or red to green.
