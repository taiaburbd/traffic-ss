# traffic-signal simulation and violation detection
this software enginerring course project for MAIA 
The main idea of this project is to create a simulation of traffic intersection and violation detection using Python.

1. Simulate the operation of a traffic light 
2. Simulate the operation of a pedestrian light 
3. Detect if a car is in violation or not
4. Detect if a pedestrian is in violation 
5. Display a message if there is a violation

Traffic light regulates the flow of traffic between vehicles and pedestrians in one way or another.

Red light > stop and wait behind the stop line
Yellow light > stop unless you crossed the stop line before it turned yellow
Green light > go if the way is clear

Each traffic light has a timer that indicates the time remaining before the traffic light changes from green to yellow, yellow to red, or red to green.
